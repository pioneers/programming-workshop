## Lesson 2 - Integers

Last lesson we were able to print numbers using print statements:

    print(24)
    
Let's explore what else is possible.

We can use our traditional math operations: 

* Addition: `+`
* Subtraction: `-`
* Multiplication: `*`
* Division: `/`

We will still need to print the results: 

    print(2 + 3)

On your own, try using the different operations. With these operations, we have Python become our own calculator. Just how smart though is our Python calculator? Does it follow the order of operations?

Order of Operations: certain operations are done before others. PEMDAS : parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division, addition and subtraction.

Let's test this - consider the statement below:

    print(2 + 3 * 10)

What would print if Python followed order of operations? What would print if Python did not follow order of operations? Try it out by entering the statement in the top left box and hitting run.

We can confirm our conclusion with another experiment. What should the following statement print?

    print(8 * (3 + 4))

We've tried out operations on numbers - but what about with `"words"`? We'll look at this in the next lesson.

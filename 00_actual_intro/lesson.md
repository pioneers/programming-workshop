## Introduction - Getting Started

Welcome to the Software Challenges. This page will get you familiar with the platform we're using.

We've prepared 8 software challenges for you in roughly ascending difficulty. Feel free to skip if you need. If you're having trouble, ask PiE staff for help in person or on Piazza (forum.pierobotics.org).

Let's get started with a walk through of our classroom.

### What are all these boxes?

You'll see three different boxes in your browser tab. 

        *------------*-------------*
        |Python      |             |
        |Script      |             |
        |Mode        |             |
        *------------*   Lesson    *
        |Python      |             |
        |Interactive |             |
        |Mode        |             |
        *------------*-------------*

This is box contains the Lesson. We'll teach you about Python and give you instructions about programming here.

The top right box is Python Script Mode. You can type Python code into the top right box and click the `run>` button above this box to run the code. The results of your code will display in the bottom left box.

Click `run>` to run our Python code, `print("Hello World!")`. You should see the following appear in the bottom left box.

        >
        Hello World!

The bottom left box is Python Interactive Mode. Python code you write directly in this box will run immediately.

Click on the bottom left box and type in `print("Hello World!")` and then press the `Enter` key on your keyboard. You should see the following appear in the bottom left box.

        > print("Hello World!")
        Hello World!

### Submission

When you finish each challenge, you can submit with the `submit` button on the top right. We will give you feedback on the program that you've written in the top left box. If you get stuck, ask a friend or PiE staff for help!


### Got it?

When you're ready, hit `submit` and continue on to the first challenge.

# Intro to Programming Workshop

## Introduction - Getting Started

Welcome to the Introduction to Programming Workshop. 

By the end of this workshop, you should understand how to program with Python. Unlike previous years, we will not be covering how to program your robot so that it drives. Rather, we will concentrate our time on how to use Python. Much of our workshop will be applicable to programming your robot, and everything you learn here will strengthen your understanding of Python.

We've prepared 10 lessons to help you learn Python. We recommend you go through the lessons and checkpoints in order, as the concepts will stack on top of each other. You can skip arounds lessons if you need. If you're having trouble, ask PiE staff for help. If you're not working on the workshop at Kickoff, ask on Piazza for help (http://piazza.com/pioneers_in_engineering/spring2018/pierc).

Let's get started with a walk through of our classroom.

### What are all these boxes?

You'll see three different boxes in your browser tab. 

        *------------*-------------*
        |Python      |             |
        |Script      |             |
        |Mode        |             |
        *------------*   Lesson    *
        |Python      |             |
        |Interactive |             |
        |Mode        |             |
        *------------*-------------*

This is box contains the Lesson. We'll teach you about Python and give you instructions about programming here.

The top right box is Python Script Mode. You can type Python code into the top right box and click the `run>` button above this box to run the code. The results of your code will display in the bottom left box.

Click `run>` to run our Python code, `print("Hello World!")`. You should see the following appear in the bottom left box.

        >
        Hello World!

The bottom left box is Python Interactive Mode. Python code you write directly in this box will run immediately.

Click on the bottom left box and type in `print("Hello World!")` and then press the `Enter` key on your keyboard. You should see the following appear in the bottom left box.

        > print("Hello World!")
        Hello World!

### Submission

When you finish each lesson or checkpoint, you can submit with the `submit` button on the top right. We will give you feedback on the program that you've written in the top left box. If you get stuck, ask a friend or PiE staff for help!

### Got it?

When you're ready, hit `submit` and continue on to the Lesson 1.

## Lesson 3 - `int`s and `float`s

In our last lesson, we worked a lot with numbers such as `314` or `24`. These numbers are examples of `int`s, short for integers. `int` is a data type, or one category of data that we can use to work with Python.

Example `int`s:

* `314`
* `24`
* `2018`
* `0`
* `-5`

When we add, subtract or multiply two `int`s, the result will be another `int`.

You can check for yourself with the following:

    print(314)
    print(type(314))
    print(9 + 9)
    print(type(9 + 9))

You might notice something different though when we divide. Try running the following:

    print(9 / 2)
    print(type(9 / 2))

Dividing two `int`s gives us a different data type: `float`. `float` is short for floating-point number. You can think of a `float` as a number with a decimal point. Python will always display `float`s with  a decimal point.

Try experimenting more with `float`s - what are other times we will see a float? What happens if we mix `float`s and `int`s in our operations? When you're done move on to the next lesson.

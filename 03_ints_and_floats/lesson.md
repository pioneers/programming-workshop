## Lesson 3 - `int`s and `float`s

In our last lesson, we worked a lot with numbers such as `314` or `24`. These numbers are examples of `int`s, short for integers. `int` is a data type, or one category of data that we can use to work with Python.

Example `int`s:

* `314`
* `24`
* `2018`
* `0`
* `-5`

When we add, subtract or multiply two `int`s, the result will be another `int`.

You can check for yourself with the following:

    print(314)
    print(type(314))
    print(9 + 9)
    print(type(9 + 9))

You might notice something different though when we divide. Try running the following:

    print(9 / 2)
    print(type(9 / 2))

Dividing two `int`s gives us a different data type: `float`. You can think of a `float` as a number with a decimal point. Python will always display `float`s with  a decimal point.

Try experimenting more with `float`s - what are other times we will see a float? What happens if we mix `float`s and `int`s in our operations? When you're done move on to the next lesson.

In Lesson 1 we made the screen display `Hello World!` using the statement `print("Hello World!")`. 

`"Hello World!"` is an example of a String. A String is a data type or one category of the data we've been using to work with Python. Strings are similar to text - they are a group of letters or characters. We mark strings by surrounding them with quotation marks `"`.

Example Strings:

* `"Hello World!"`
* `"Pioneers in Engineering"`
* `"robot"`
* `"An entire sentence is a string."`
* `"Symbols can be in a string too :)"`

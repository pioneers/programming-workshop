Repl.it classroom for the software challenge

Instructions:

Each folder constitutes one assignment or web page on the Repl.it classroom. Folders should be named with the format `xx_lesson_name`. For example `00_introdcution`, `13_powers_of_two`.

Each folder should have four files:
* lesson.md: contains the written documentation for the challenge
* lesson_settings.json: contains settings for the assignment, specifically the lesson title
        * the lesson title should mirror the name of the folder for ease of editing
* main.py: the starter code for the project
* lesson_tests.py: unit tests in Python's standard unit test format
        * The [Python Unittest library documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html) is the best source of knowledge for how to write this.
        * EDU has not written many of these previously. New ground.

The [official documentation for Repl.it classroom in Github](https://repl.it/site/docs/github-classrooms) is best for specifics.

What do we need to do?

2. Create a new folder / assignment for each of the [software challenges](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SxKTVxkzmEzONFTn6Kwz0CNB6Frb--Gi6WhyCywK0Bc/edit#heading=h.4o251psbzs42). We'll need to copy over each of the documentation and starter code. Start the numbering at 13
3. Develop the unit tests to thoroughly test the student code. We will have not hidden tests --> the unit test should test all aspects of student code.
4. Deploy to the classroom (ask Scott)
5. Test to ensure our unit tests and starter code is working.
6. Add documentation to ensure students know how to transfer their work to the robot (ask Runtime).

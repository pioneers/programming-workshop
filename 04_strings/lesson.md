## Lesson 4 - Strings

In Lesson 1 we made the screen display `Hello World!` using the statement `print("Hello World!")`. 

`"Hello World!"` is an example of a `str` short for string. A string is another data type. Strings are similar to text - they are a group of letters or characters. We mark strings by surrounding them with quotation marks `"`.

Example Strings:

* `"Hello World!"`
* `"Pioneers in Engineering"`
* `"robot"`
* `"An entire sentence is a string."`
* `"Symbols can be in a string too :)"`

We can combine strings together through addition - try it out:

    print("one fish, two fish," + "red fish, blue fish")

Notice that we add two strings, there is no space added between the strings. You'll need to include a space in either of the strings to successfully print `one fish, two fish, red fish, blue fish`.

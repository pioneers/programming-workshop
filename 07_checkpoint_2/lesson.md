# Intro to Programming Workshop

## Checkpoint 2 

Let's check our progress!

If you're currently at our Kick Off workshop, feel free to ask a friend for help or call over PiE staff to get some help. If you're at home and get stuck, make a post on our [forum](piazza.com/pioneers_in_engineering/spring2018/pierc)! We'll help you out.

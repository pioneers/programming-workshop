# Let's create a new variable to keep track of how many eggs we have
num_eggs = 0

# You checked the fridge and there's a full carton of 12 eggs in there.
# Update our variable for how many eggs we have.

# Start your code here

# End your code here

print("I have", num_eggs, "eggs")

# You made some scrambled eggs and removed 2 eggs from the carton.
# Update our variable for how many eggs.

# Try to use a method different than num_eggs = 10 that uses the
# current value of num_eggs.

# Start your code here

# End your code here

print("After making scrambled eggs, I have", num_eggs, "eggs")

# Unfortunately while putting away the eggs, you dropped one on the
# counter and formed a shape that is conveniently a perfect circle.
# What's the area of this circle?

# You happen to have a very exact ruler and measure the radius
radius = 2.3452

# You also happen to have Pi written down
pi = 3.1459265

# Start your code here - you'll need to assign area to something different
area = 0
# End your code hyere

print("The area of the egg is", area)

# Next Power

```
def next_power(num):
```

Find the smallest power of 2 (with a non-negative exponent) that is greater than or equal to the input. Return the result. This kind of calculation is useful for finding out how much computer memory (in “bits”) is needed to store a number that is at most as large as our input.
Examples:
```
>>>next_power(2)
2
>>>next_power(3)
4
>>>next_power(2557)
4096
>>>next_power(0)
1
```
